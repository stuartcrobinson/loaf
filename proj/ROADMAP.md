loaf-cli 


FIVE things i want to finish before release 

- hooks for custom git etc before and after executions
- fs permissions - read/write allowlist/denylist
- tools allowlist (to block cmd line stuff for file security)
- LLM instructions generator (based on tools allowlist)
- loaf init -- create the loaf.yaml file with file permissions based on cwd



- npx run usage
- settings file loaf.yaml - hooks, fs permissions 

LATER:

- copy paste mode 
    - include clipboard watcher to automatically execute outputs that have been copied and then if user copies "nesl" 
- git squash stuff
