ACT I
SCENE I. Elsinore. A platform before the castle.
FRANCISCO at his post. Enter to him BERNARDO
BERNARDO
Who's there? Speak, I charge thee!
Is it friend or foe that walks these ramparts
In this bitter cold and darksome hour?
Is it friend or foe that walks these ramparts
In this bitter cold and darksome hour?
Is it friend or foe that walks these ramparts
In this bitter cold and darksome hour?
FRANCISCO
Nay, answer me: stand, and unfold yourself.
BERNARDO
Long live the king!
FRANCISCO
Bernardo?
BERNARDO
He.
FRANCISCO
You come most carefully upon your hour.
Have you had quiet guard? No stirrings
In the night, no shadows moving where
They ought not be, no whispers on the wind?
'Tis now struck twelve; get thee to bed, Francisco.
FRANCISCO
For this relief much thanks: 'tis bitter cold,
And I am sick at heart.
BERNARDO
I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who's there?
Declare yourselves before you take another step,
For I'll not let unknown figures pass unchallenged!
FRANCISCO
Not a mouse stirring.
BERNARDO
Well, good night.
If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,
The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.
FRANCISCO
I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who's there?
Who hath relieved you? Tell me true,
Which soldier takes your place upon this watch,
That I may know all's well before I go?

HORATIO
Friends to this ground.
MARCELLUS
And liegemen to the Dane.
FRANCISCO
Give you good night.
MARCELLUS
O, farewell, honest soldier:
Who hath relieved you?
FRANCISCO
Bernardo has my place.
Give you good night.
