You're absolutely right! On macOS, `/tmp` is actually a symlink to `/private/tmp`. This is a macOS-specific behavior. Let me check this online to confirm and find the best solution.Perfect! I understand the issue now. On macOS, `/tmp` is a symlink to `/private/tmp`, and when you use `pwd` command in a directory like `/tmp/t_hooks_test/subdir`, it resolves to the real path `/private/tmp/t_hooks_test/subdir`.

This is indeed a cross-platform compatibility issue. Let me fix the test to handle this macOS-specific behavior:

#!nesl [@three-char-SHA-256: j1k]
action = "file_replace_text"
path = "/Users/stuart/repos/loaf/proj/comp/hooks/test/integration/hooks-basic.test.ts"
old_text = <<'EOT_j1k'
  test('custom cwd works', async () => {
    const subDir = `${TEST_DIR}/subdir`;
    mkdirSync(subDir, { recursive: true });
    
    const config = {
      hooks: {
        before: [
          { run: 'pwd > output.txt', cwd: subDir }
        ]
      }
    };

    const hooks = new HooksManager(config);
    const result = await hooks.runBefore();
    
    expect(result.success).toBe(true);
    const output = readFileSync(`${subDir}/output.txt`, 'utf8').trim();
    expect(output).toBe(subDir);
  });
EOT_j1k
new_text = <<'EOT_j1k'
  test('custom cwd works', async () => {
    const subDir = `${TEST_DIR}/subdir`;
    mkdirSync(subDir, { recursive: true });
    
    const config = {
      hooks: {
        before: [
          { run: 'pwd > output.txt', cwd: subDir }
        ]
      }
    };

    const hooks = new HooksManager(config);
    const result = await hooks.runBefore();
    
    expect(result.success).toBe(true);
    const output = readFileSync(`${subDir}/output.txt`, 'utf8').trim();
    
    // On macOS, /tmp is a symlink to /private/tmp, so pwd might return the resolved path
    // We need to handle both cases for cross-platform compatibility
    const expectedPaths = [
      subDir,
      subDir.replace(/^\/tmp/, '/private/tmp')
    ];
    
    expect(expectedPaths).toContain(output);
  });
EOT_j1k
#!end_j1k

Now let's run the test again to see if it passes:

#!nesl [@three-char-SHA-256: k2l]
action = "exec"
lang = "bash"
code = <<'EOT_k2l'
cd /Users/stuart/repos/loaf
npm test -- proj/comp/hooks/test/integration/hooks-basic.test.ts
EOT_k2l
#!end_k2l

Once this test passes, we should think about next steps. Based on the architecture documents, I think we should:

1. **Integrate hooks with the orchestrator** - This is the most important next step since hooks need to be called by the main loaf orchestrator
2. **Add more edge case tests** - Test scenarios like missing variables, invalid YAML, file not found, etc.
3. **Create example configurations** - Show common VCS integration patterns
4. **Consider shell detection** - For Windows compatibility (PowerShell vs cmd)

The integration with orchestrator is probably the highest priority since that's where hooks will actually be used. What do you think we should tackle next?
